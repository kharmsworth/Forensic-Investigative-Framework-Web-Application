			<h1>ANALYSIS</h1>
		</div>

		<p>The Analysis phase forms the third phase, overall, for the investigation and therefore the framework. Throughout this phase, a team of technicians will be working towards the main goal of drawing out all of the useful information from the evidence distributed in the previous phase. This phase can be broken down into three smaller stages: Pre-analysis, Club and Compare, and Final Analysis.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Pre-Analysis:</h3>
		<p>Pre-analysis is the stage of an investigation where the potential evidence is analysed by the team members individually. This stage benefits from the use of forensic tools such as FTKImager and Autopsy, both of which grant a different perspective of the drives. As suggested this could include hybrid analysis, tracing the hacker, or the formation and analysis of a Chain of Artefacts (CoA).</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Club and Compare:</h3>
		<p>The club and compare stage of an investigation is where we see the team come together again to discuss their findings and compare them against each other to reach a confident and cohesive conclusion for each lead suggested. There may be more than one lead that needs to be proved or otherwise. Once the comparisons have been made and any conclusions have been drawn, these conclusions are ‘clubbed’ together to produce an independent forensic result, which will be referred to in the next stages.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Final Analysis:</h3>
		<p>The final analysis stage of the investigation is implemented to double-check the evidence linked to the independent forensic result. As well as this, it features the team ensuring that the entirety of the investigative team is aware of the conclusion drawn before initializing the final phase, the ‘Reporting Phase’.</p>

			<h3>CASE STUDY</h3>
			<p>This stage of the investigation features the use of the Autopsy and FTKImager software in the hopes of uncovering the type of encryption used to encrypt the victim’s files. This can be done through the running of modules over the device to identify any potentially malicious-looking files, including, in this case, the initial link used by the victim that allowed the suspect access to the device, ultimately allowing the encryption to occur. Now that we have the malicious link and the email used to send it, we can backtrack to the sender’s IP address to find the suspect. As well as this, we can analyse the link and its responsive actions to better understand the encryption used and how to, if it is possible, decrypt the victim’s files on their drive.</p>
