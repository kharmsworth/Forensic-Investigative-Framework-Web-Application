			<h1>REPORTING</h1>
		</div>

		<p>The reporting phase oversees the creation of a final report for the process undergone and the presentation of the forensic and analysis steps taken to achieve the expected level of results. This step is particularly important for the legal side of the investigation as it details the evidence found and what conclusions can be drawn from it in a non-biased manner. This stage is further broken down into three stages: Result and Improvement, Reporting and Presentation, and Returning Evidence.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Result and Improvement:</h3>
		<p>The result and improvements stage follows the investigation team and their approach to solidifying their final analysis result, all whilst acknowledging the potential evidence that has been found going against their claims in hopes of providing a non-biased report. In addition to this, the team will try to find any potential loopholes in their process and its findings, making an effort not to replicate these in the future.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Reporting and Presentation:</h3>
		<p>The reporting a presentation stage of the framework provides a summary of all the steps followed to obtain the evidence found and details all the final independent forensic results found in the process. This can be done in the form of a final document or the showing the blockchain of custody created in the initial preservation stages of the investigation.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Returning Evidence:</h3>
		<p>This stage follows the team's implementation of the proper protocol for the files processed within the investigation. This includes making sure all the evidence is catalogued correctly and disposed of if needed according to the current laws and regulations implemented in the UK or other nations.</p>

			<h3>CASE STUDY</h3>
			<p>This stage of the investigation consists of clearing up loose ends and professionally documenting the process. In the example of this case study, this would consist of taking the report template and filling in the individual sections according to the process followed and actions taken to gain the desired result. After this, the Chain of Custody document is completed with the final disposition entered and signed off, therefore completing the framework and the investigation from a digital forensics point of view.</p>
