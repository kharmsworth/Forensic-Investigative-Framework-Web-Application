			<h1>COLLECTION & EXAMINATION</h1>
		</div>

		<p>Phase two, titled the ‘Collection and Examination Phase,’ consists of preserving and extracting the data found on the suspect’s seized devices. This phase can be broken down into smaller stages titled' Collection, Preservation, and Distribution'.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Collection:</h3>
		<p>The collection stage of an investigation can be deemed successful upon the collection of several different artefacts that can be further analysed to produce evidence on the case. Linking this stage back to the awareness stage, we can confidently take the pre-established key areas and collect any data belonging to those areas and pass it onwards for further analysis. This technique is like those used within the work of (Athanasios Dimitriadis, 2020).</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Preservation:</h3>
		<p>The preservation stage consists of the preservation of any evidence found within the seized devices. This task can be carried out through the use of a blockchain chain of custody system that starts at the initial seizure of the devices from the crime scene, through a software like Microsoft Excel, or even by hand through the documentation of who has the exhibit, when they initialy recieved it, when they returned it, and what process were performed on the exhibit itself. </p>
		<br>
		<h3>Distribution:</h3>
		<p>The distribution stage of the investigation includes the creation and distribution of the collected data to the designated investigation team. These tasks can be carried out through the creation of .E01 files from the device’s drives and the sending of these files, using a secure channel, to the technicians who will be analysing the drives for any potential evidence.</p>

			<h3>CASE STUDY</h3>
			<p>This stage of the investigation is all about the seizing, copying, and distribution of the drives taken from our victim’s devices. For the sake of clarity, the device for this investigation has already been seized by the on-site team and transported back to the forensic team with a Chain of Custody being initiated following the example template given. After being given the device, the team used FTKImager to create a usable exhibit for any further examination, this exhibit is then shared with the team of forensic analysts.</p>
