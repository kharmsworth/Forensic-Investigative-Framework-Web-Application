			<h1>United Forensic Investigation Platform</h1>
			<p>Welcome to the Unified Forensic Investigation Platform (UFIP), a platform designed around creating a new forensic framework approach to performing an investigation into a device that had been attacked via a malicious form of cryptographic ransomware. The framework created has taken inspiration from several published works as referenced within the literature review that is available here [insert a link to the literature review here]. Throughout this application, you can find an outline of each phase of the investigation and a description of what will occur within each phase respectively. </p>
			<p>The following webpages are designed with you, the user, in mind and will start with a general analysis of your progress so far. Worry not, if you are just beginning the investigation yourself, this product is designed to walk you through the framework from which milestone you currently find yourself at. The analysis is performed via a checklist system available on the next page, so take some time to read through the general information of the individual phases and hit the ‘I’m ready’ button to the right to get started.</p>
