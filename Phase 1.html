			<h1>PREPERATION</h1>
		</div>

		<p>Phase one is aptly titled the ‘Preparation Phase’. During this phase of the framework, the investigating team is tasked with identifying the data found on the seized device as well as preparing the investigating team on how to work with the software and materials for the later phases. This phase can be further broken down into three stages (Awareness, Identification, and Preparation), furthering the identification and preparation for the upcoming examination of the devices found.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Awareness:</h3>
		<p>The first step in every investigation is ensuring that it can proceed properly and that all potential evidence can be processed correctly. These ideals can be completed by ensuring that all the available software is usable and that all the members of the investigative team are briefed on how to use the software and their workstations. In addition to this, establishing any key areas of the victim’s device that have the highest probability of producing evidential information can be done at this stage.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Identification:</h3>
		<p>Following this, the next step is to implement a procedure that can detect and confirm that a crime has taken place on the device. This step can be completed through the finding of an initial malicious program and the performing of both static and dynamic malware analysis. Furthermore, the scanning of the victim’s device for any obvious malicious activity can aid with the later phases of the investigation.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Preperation:</h3>
		<p>One of the most important underlying parts of any investigation is the maintenance and training of the tools that a most likely to be featured. This includes updating any of the software that has alerted to needing updates and training the team members in how to correctly use the software to gain the expected results.</p>

			<h3>CASE STUDY</h3>
			<p>During this time, the team is briefed on the case itself, the software that will be used, and how to use the desired software, in the example of this case study, the alleged crime follows a target device that has become a host to a form of malicious cryptographic ransomware that has taken all the target’s files and encrypted them with an email being sent denoting that the suspect will give the files back unchanged if the target pays them a sum of £10,000. Throughout this investigation, the software Autopsy and FTKImager will be used for any forensic examination alongside Microsoft Excel for the implementation of a Chain of Custody.</p>
